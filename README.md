Fine tuned the llama-2 open source langcuage model form Hugging face on the Indian Law dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/jizzu/llama2_indian_law_v4
using the LoRA (Low-Rank-Adaptation) technique which in place of changing the weights of the full model all parameters only 
does changes with the smaller parameters.

Which fine-tuning large models more efficient and cost-effective.
